An application that takes an input of heads of tails from a user and gives back 
a side of the coin. Depending on what the user input there will be a response of
win or lose. 
# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express 
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. I wanted my coin flip
to take place on the server this is why express was used, and wanted to be able to render my 
results on the DOM with ejs
# Lessons Learned
This was one of my first exposures to developing on the back end. Alot of valuable debugging came from this
and showed me how to interact with DOM through the server. Writing logic for the server side is completely different
from the front end.
